# ‚úàÔ∏è FlightOps Portal ‚Äì Console-Based Airline Management System

A fully functional **console-based flight operations portal**, built in C with two operational modes: **Admin** and **User**. This project simulates a basic airline system with real-time flight data manipulation, booking options, airport mapping, FAQs, and more.

## üé∂ Project Summary (as on Resume)

> Created a role-based airport management system with Admin and User modes to manage and view flight data securely. Admin could add/update flights, while Users could view info through an intuitive map showing terminal distances. Integrated login systems, file-based storage, and clean object-oriented structure for clarity and reuse. This project simulated a real-world use case where structured data flow and access restriction were critical, helping reinforce Python and system design skills.
